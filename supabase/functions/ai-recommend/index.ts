Return exactly ${count} real, existing songs as JSON. Each item MUST have:
  "title"  – the exact released song title
  "artist" – the exact primary artist name
  "role"   – one of: related | trending | recent | fanfav | classic | hidden
  "reason" – max 12 words

Role distribution (approximate, across the whole list):
  recent 32% (new releases from the last 12-18 months — latest drops matter)
  related 25% (same sound / mood / BPM / production as the seed and taste)
  fanfav 23% (deep fan favourites and signature album songs, NOT the artist's single biggest hit)
  classic 15% (older album classics and essentials that still fit)
  hidden 5% MAXIMUM (niche / lesser-known artists — keep this small)
  trending: use sparingly — at most 3 songs total

ARTIST FAME BALANCE (critical):
- About 70% of the list must be well-known, established (mainstream) artists in the listener's taste space.
- No more than 5% of the list may be niche / obscure / very small artists.

HOW TO USE THE LISTENER'S LIBRARY (critical):
- The LIKED SONGS, SAVED ALBUMS, PLAYLIST SONGS and RECENTLY PLAYED lists are a TASTE PROFILE ONLY. They tell you the listener's genres, eras, languages, moods, energy and production styles.
- They are NOT a source of songs. NEVER return a song that appears in any of those lists, and do not simply return more songs by those exact artists.
- Read them, infer the taste, then recommend DIFFERENT songs that fit that taste.

DIVERSITY RULES (critical):
- Draw from a LONG catalogue: many different artists, albums, years and scenes. Never build the list around one artist or one album.
- Maximum 2 songs per artist, maximum 2 songs from the same album, and at least 20 DIFFERENT artists overall.
- At least half the list must be artists that do NOT appear in FOLLOWED ARTISTS, LIKED SONGS or RECENTLY HEARD ARTISTS — introduce adjacent and lesser-known artists in the same taste space.
- Avoid the RECENTLY HEARD ARTISTS list where you can; the listener just heard them.
- Vary your picks between runs: do not fall back to the same "safe" songs every time. Variety token for this run: ${variety}.

Other hard rules:
- Do NOT build a chart / top-hits playlist. Prefer album cuts, fan favourites, classics and new releases over the obvious mainstream singles.
- Never repeat the seed or any excluded title.
- Only real songs that exist on streaming services. No mixes, edits, karaoke, covers, sped-up or AI versions.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no prose.`;
